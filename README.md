# 🏦 PyBank

## 📌 Overview
**PyBank** is a Python-based banking management system designed as a collaborative learning and development project.  
It simulates real-world banking operations while applying core and advanced Python programming concepts,  
including **OOP, file handling, data structures, and Excel reporting**.

The project is divided into **multiple phases** — with **Phase One** focused on implementing the core features,  
and later phases introducing more advanced functionalities.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Build a **realistic banking simulation** using only Python.
- Demonstrate mastery of:
  - Variables, data types, and data structures (`list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`)
  - Loops, conditions, and functions
  - File handling (CSV/JSON)
  - Classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation
  - `datetime` library for timestamps and scheduling
  - Excel reporting using `openpyxl`
- Apply **GitHub collaboration workflows** with branching and pull requests.
- Prepare for **multi-developer teamwork** with assigned tasks and deadlines.
